# Book2Audio

## Where I am 

At current the selected work must be manualy split into digestable pieces for processing through online services such as AWS Polly
The audio must then be downloaded and converted manually. I have been stuck on blocking segments for upload to a bucket. 

## Where I am Going
My todo list includes:
** Creation of a front end allowing cloud selection (google, AWS, Azure, Watson) voice selection and monitoring of process. **
! splitting text to manageable size for s3 buckets
! automate download and splice audio
! auto update project guttenberg csv 
! use open ai to give a book summary
! integrate dalle to provide visuals
! Integrate video conversion to 
! connect to YouTube for automatic upload
 
## The end goal 
is an automatic conversion of public domain books into audiobooks.
