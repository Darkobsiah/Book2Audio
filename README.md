# Book2Audio
# Where Im at
The basic functionality works. I can break a book down into several sections and upload to AWS, Google Cloud, or any other cloud service and use the Cloud services AI TTS. The problem is I have to upload in segments and piece the segmants together after using another application.

# Where Im going
This has been shelved for now as I have had more pertinent tasks to complete. It does not mean I have given up on it. In fact I think the advancement is AI will contribute to this project in the near future

#The End Game
The end goal is an automatic conversion of public domain books into audiobooks. 
At current the selected work must be manualy split into digestable pieces for processing through online services such as AWS Polly
