# Book2Audio

## Where I am ##
I am leaving this one public for posterity sake but...
This project was rebuilt and expanded using Django to provide a db and other more better features. 
 The new version includes a speed reader that displays a single word at a time. This can be sped up to 5000 WPM.
 There is also an auto update for the db pulling from online sources on a weekly basis.
 Furthermore Chat GPT is integrated for the voice which is the best I have found for reading text.
  That being said, if you know a better TTS engine I am all ears.
 If you are interested in the new build please send me a DM and we can colaborate.
## Where I am Going ##
My todo list includes:

** Creation of a front end allowing cloud selection (google, AWS, Azure, Watson) voice selection and monitoring of process.**

   splitting text to manageable size for s3 buckets
   
   automate download and splice audio
   
   auto update project guttenberg csv 
   
   use open ai to give a book summary
   
   integrate dalle to provide visuals
   
   Integrate video conversion to 
   
   connect to social media for automatic upload
 
## The end goal ##
is an automatic conversion of public domain books into audiobooks by TTS engines. The best so far is Open AI TTS-HD
